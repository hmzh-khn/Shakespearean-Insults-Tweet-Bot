Song Lyrics Reimagined:
i came in like a.. miley cyrus
don't stop....believing
I wish that I was Jesse's ...
Stacy's ... has got it going on
just a small town...
can you feel the ... tonight
wake me up, when ... ends
don't you worry, don't you worry ... see.. has a .. for you
I'm a ... from ... and a .... engineer
there's a place off ... avenue
you shook me all night
we will, we will rock you
we can't stop, and we won't stop
what does the fox say
welcome to the new age to the new age
we're up all night to get some, we're up all night to get lucky
i'm gonna pop some tags -- thrift shop
